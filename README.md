with windows restore

## tl;dr
windows restore is too tired.
take it automation?

## require
- onedrive

## flow
- install
    - install scoop
    - scoop update
    - comply with sp932
- save
    - save list installed by scoop
    - and others(`.ssh`, `.bashrc`...)
- restore
    - rollback form onedrive
